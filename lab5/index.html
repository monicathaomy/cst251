					were not very bad, Emma and I did not get the link working but we tried
					to Zoom call each other to figure everything out. As well as the other labs we
					scheuduled an office hour with Professor Modes and tried to get everything to run smoothly
					unlike how the last lab went. We also modified the last lab too.
