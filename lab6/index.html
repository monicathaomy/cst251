 				<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>

			<h2>Big Idea</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this lab is to work
				with my partner and get comfortable with creating an html file
				and then style it with a CSS file. As well as getting to understand making a form linking
				on 'div' wrapping it all up by linking it onto CSS. After as usual, we would have to test if the files
				will run locally by uploading them to the server.

			</aside>  </p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p> Some challenges that we faced were just getting used to creating the
					forms and remembering the order of placement of the form structure. Also
					I was a bit confused of what "div" was suppose to do.

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results were very successfully, everything worked as plan! As seen in
					the screenshots!
