		<h1>Random Paragraph:</h1>
			<p> Welcome to my page!<br>
				I'm Monica Thaomy To, people call me MT. I'm from Southside San Jose, and I love city life.<br>
				My favorite things to do are also my passion. I love creating whether it's painting, crafts, poems, <br>
				food, etc. So that is why I chose my major, design beinging an element of it. I love exploring nature, especially beaches
				and in the mountains like Yosemite, that's why I chose Monterey Bay, as there is a beach at every corner. <br>
				My dreams are to become a sucessful designer and I would like to relocate to Los Angeles in the near future because that's
				where my major and degree would thrive the most. Some of my guilty pleasures are boba, sleeping, swimming,
				 online shopping and buying a lot of food.</p>

		<h1> Challenges doing this lab: </h1>
		<p> Thankfully, I did not face any challenges while delivering this lab, because I had practice <br>
			with text elements before in the previous labs and with the help of my partner's knowledge on fonts. <br>
			Now, I am just adding on to my knowledge of fonts and it's elements. I found it easy to navigate to styling sidebars.<br>
