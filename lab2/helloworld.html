    <h1 style="color:#FFE4E1;">Hello World.</h1>
      <p style="color:#FFE4E1;">Our names are Emma Alexander and Monica To.
      We are second year Communication Design students
      at CSUMB. Our concentration is in Visual Design.
      We are very eager to learn how to code and create
      websites with Professor Wes. Emma is from Southern
      California and Monica is from Northern California.
      Emma likes to sleep, take photos, watch Netflix,
      and go to the beach in her free time, and Monica likes
      to paint, draw, swim, and do her makeup. Both of them are
      Starbucks enthusiasts, especially with it now being
      pumpkin spice latte season.</p>
