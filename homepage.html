		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p >Hello! My name is Monica To, I'm from San Jose,CA! I'm a sophomore at Cal State Monterey Bay
			with a major in Visual Communication Deisgn and a minor in marketing.
			Some of my hobbies include digital creating as well as painting
			during my free time. Art has been a passion of mine growing up and I would
			love to experiment the art of coding as well.
			Some of my favorite applications include Indesign, Photoshop and Lightroom.
			I have a feeling that this class will come in	handy into the near future as I explore
			 more with graphic deisgning on websites.</p>
