			<h1> Purpose of Lab:</h1>
				<p> The big idea of this lab is to get more comfortable with DIV and CSS selectors <br>
					by adding different functions to the styled element. Specifically, hovering over <br>
					an image to make the size change.A combination of multiple style elements at a time. <br>
					After completed, as usual we will run and test the files locally.</p>

				<h1> Challenges: </h1>
					<p> A challenge that I had in the beginning was getting DIV on the image. <br>
					I know I did it on the last lab, but I struggled to find what went wrong <br>
					because I checked my code	and they are the same for the style border. <br>
					Another challenge I had was understanding how div and classes differentiate. <br> </p>

				<h1> Results </h1>
		<p> The results of these lab did take a while to finish all the tasks. Emma and I had to <br>
		talk for awhile via Zoom to finish this lab, the results were delievered via pdf as screenshots.</p>
