				<h1> Challenges doing this lab: </h1>
				<p> We just had to dicover a lot of new things, like change the background image to a particular size in ordr to make it fit. <br>
					Also, I was suppose to drive this lab but something did not work in my html so Emma tried it on hers and we had more luck. <br>
