		<p style="color:#FFE4E1;">The idea of this lab was to create a local file
			structure on my computer for my cst251 folder, add labs, css, and image
			folders, and lastly add index.html files to each lab folder.</p>
	<h2 style="color:#FFE4E1;">Challenges</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFE4E1;">I have always been very interested in learning digital structure, so creating and
	               maintaining file structures has always been interesting and a little challengiong but to an extent
								 of learning.Along with this, our folders were already premade when we
			originally had created our respiratory with img, css, and index.html (also
			js). I did run into a	problem with accidentally choosing the wrong
			index.html file so had to re arrange them within my folders a bit and make
			sure it was the correct one under the correct lab folder in Atom.</p>
